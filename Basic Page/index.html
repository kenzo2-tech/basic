 <h2>Upbringing</h2> 
 <h4 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> Growing up in New York is a blessing. I was born and raised in the bronx. Moved to Texas for 8 months and moved back. What can I say, the city called my family back. Ive always been a creative kid, I was in art clubs in all schools I was in. I was even part of creating props for a theater show I did in 5th grade. Even that, I was a main actor in 3rd grade in my school show. Over the years I feel Ive lost my creatie tocuhed, but living in New York City surroundig me with all the arts encourgaes me more.
